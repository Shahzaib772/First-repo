""
"Problem Statement"
"A company claims that the average weight of their product packages is 500 grams. A quality control inspector randomly selects 10 packages and weighs them. Test whether the company's claim is valid at a 5% significance level."

"Step 1: State the Hypotheses"
"Null Hypothesis (H0):","μ = 500 (The mean weight is 500 grams)"
"Alternative Hypothesis (H1):","μ ≠ 500 (The mean weight is not 500 grams)"
""
"Step 2: Significance Level"
"Alpha (α):","0.05 (5%)"
"Test Type:","Two-tailed t-test"
""
"Step 3: Calculate Sample Statistics"
"Sample Size (n):","10"
"Sample Mean (x̄):","500.2"
"Sample Standard Deviation (s):","3.94"
""
"Step 4: Calculate Test Statistic"
"Formula:","t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)"
"Calculation:","t = (500.2 - 500) / (3.94 / √10)"
"t-statistic:","0.16"
""
"Step 5: Determine Critical Value"
"Degrees of Freedom (df):","9"
"Critical t-value (two-tailed):","±2.262"
""
"Step 6: Decision Rule"
"Rule:","Reject H0 if |t| > 2.262"
"Calculated |t|:","0.16"
"Is |t| > Critical Value?:","No"
""
"Step 7: Conclusion"
"Decision:","Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis"
"Interpretation:","At the 5% significance level, there is not enough evidence to reject the company's claim that the average package weight is 500 grams."
""
"Summary"
"The sample data supports the company's claim. The packages appear to have an average weight consistent with 500 grams."
