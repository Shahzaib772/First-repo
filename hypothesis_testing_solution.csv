"Problem Statement"
"A company claims that the average weight of their product packages is 500 grams. A quality control inspector randomly selects 10 packages and weighs them. Test whether the company's claim is valid at a 5% significance level."

"Step 1: State the Hypotheses"
"Null Hypothesis (H0):","μ = 500 (The mean weight is 500 grams)"
"Alternative Hypothesis (H1):","μ ≠ 500 (The mean weight is not 500 grams)"
""
"Step 2: Significance Level"
"Alpha (α):","0.05"
"Test Type:","Two-tailed one-sample t-test"
""
"Step 3: Sample Statistics (Using Excel Functions)"
"Sample Size (n):","=COUNT(B2:B11)"
"Sample Mean (x̄):","=AVERAGE(B2:B11)"
"Sample Standard Deviation (s):","=STDEV.S(B2:B11)"
"Hypothesized Mean (μ0):","500"
""
"Step 4: Calculate Test Statistic Using Excel"
"t-statistic Formula:","=(AVERAGE(B2:B11)-500)/(STDEV.S(B2:B11)/SQRT(COUNT(B2:B11)))"
"t-statistic Value:","=T.TEST({498;502;495;507;499;503;496;501;504;497},{500;500;500;500;500;500;500;500;500;500},2,1)"
"Note:","For proper calculation, use the formula in the cell above"
""
"Step 5: P-Value Calculation"
"Method 1 - Using T.TEST:","=T.TEST(B2:B11,{500;500;500;500;500;500;500;500;500;500},2,1)"
"Method 2 - Using T.DIST.2T:","=T.DIST.2T(ABS((AVERAGE(B2:B11)-500)/(STDEV.S(B2:B11)/SQRT(COUNT(B2:B11)))),COUNT(B2:B11)-1)"
"Explanation:","T.TEST(array1, array2, tails, type) where tails=2 for two-tailed, type=1 for paired"
""
"Step 6: Critical Value"
"Degrees of Freedom (df):","=COUNT(B2:B11)-1"
"Critical t-value (α=0.05):","=T.INV.2T(0.05,COUNT(B2:B11)-1)"
"Formula Explanation:","T.INV.2T returns the two-tailed critical value"
""
"Step 7: Decision Rule"
"Compare:","If p-value < 0.05, Reject H0"
"Or Compare:","If |t-statistic| > critical value, Reject H0"
""
"Step 8: Conclusion"
"Decision:","=IF(T.TEST(B2:B11,{500;500;500;500;500;500;500;500;500;500},2,1)<0.05,"Reject H0", "Fail to Reject H0")"
"Interpretation:","Since p-value > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the average package weight differs from 500 grams."
